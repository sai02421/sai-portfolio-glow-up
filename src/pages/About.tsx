                Hey, I'm <span className="text-[#CDB4DB] font-bold">Sai</span> â€” a Product Manager with a builder's mindset and a user-first approach.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                My career started on the race track â€” literally â€” as part of a Formula Student team in college. But soon, I found myself more fascinated by user journeys than vehicle aerodynamics. That curiosity drove me into the world of digital products.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Since then, I've built and launched products in ed-tech and D2C e-commerce, working across AI chatbots, retention systems, onboarding flows, and partner-facing dashboards. I enjoy the messy middle of product building â€” where insights, design, and strategy collide to create experiences that stick.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                I love collaborating with cross-functional teams, diving into metrics, and iterating fast. Whether it's 0â†’1 MVPs or optimization experiments, I thrive when I'm solving real user problems that impact growth.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Outside of work, I enjoy playing pickleball, geeking out on mythology, and helping founders validate ideas and launch with speed.
              </p>
